## Project_1
### Data Gathering & Processing Project Requirements
Using Python, select datasets of choice to work with, manipulate, and join the datasets. Use at least three large-scale computation tasks to gain insights from the datasets (e.g. mrjob, spark, sparksql). Each task should result in one meaningful analysis and create visualizations to highlight insights.

## Project_2
### Exploratory Data Analysis Project Requirements
Select three questions to perform exploratory data analysis on a dataset of choice. Using R, manipulate selected dataset and perform analysis. Summarize the interesting result, relationship, or insight (or maybe lack thereof) for each question and provide data visualizations that support the analysis results.
